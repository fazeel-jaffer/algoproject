        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>
            PRmePRed is a powerful prediction tool based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) that accurately predicts
            arginine methylation sites in proteins. In eukaryotes, protein arginine methylation plays a vital role in
            various important biological processes. PRMTs (Protein arginine methyltransferases) are responsible for
            methylating a diverse range of substrates, including histones, transcription factors, and several proteins
            involved in RNA processing, transport, and translation. By utilizing sequence and structure-based
            properties, this SVM-based classifier has been developed to effectively identify potential arginine
            methylation sites in proteins.
            The performance of PRmePRed is quite promising, achieving an accuracy of 84.10% in 10-fold cross-validation.
            The tool exhibits high sensitivity (82.38%) and specificity (83.77%), indicating its ability to correctly
            identify true positive and true negative instances. The Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.7 further
            validates its reliability in making precise predictions.
            With its remarkable accuracy and robustness, PRmePRed can significantly aid researchers and biologists in
            understanding the functional implications of arginine methylation in various biological pathways and
            processes. By highlighting potential methylation sites, this tool contributes to the exploration of novel
            regulatory mechanisms and facilitates the discovery of key protein targets involved in cellular activities.
            As such, PRmePRed stands as a valuable asset in advancing our understanding of protein arginine methylation
            and its impact on cellular functions.
